 # EquationCheckingUsingStack
   How to check that either the equation is Valid or Not?
   I have used STACK to solve this problem using the following steps
1) Check if any of the parenthesis comes in the equation put it onto the stack.
2) And if the close bracket came dequeue from the stack and chk the bracket.
3) If the closing bracket is of the same opening bracket then continue and if not then the Equation is not Valid.
